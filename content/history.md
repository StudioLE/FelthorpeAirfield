## History



The following account was written by Dick Cole in 2007 for [felthorpe.net](http://felthorpe.net).

The Felthorpe Flying Group was started in about 1958 by a bunch of flying enthusiasts, after being given flights from Beck Farm flying field at Felthorpe by Eric Jarvis, in his father's Tiger Moth G-ANFM. The field had 3 small runways and a hangar; there was also a Piper Tripacer, which belonged to Jack Last of Saxthorpe. At that time the group called themselves the North Norfolk Flying Group. Jack Last was involved ina  ground handling accident at Seething airfield, when a gust of wind tipped the Tripacer over and the wing caught poor old Jack on the head and he was killed.

We were all very upset, had a meeting and decided to carry on; we decided to rename the group to the Felthorpe Flying Group. George Jarvis was President, Mike Husband Secretary and Eric Jarvis Chairman and flying instructor. George Morrison was the first to get his license, followed by Dick Cole, John Quantrell, Hack Freeman and others.

After a Macaully Flying Group dinner at the Colne House Hotel in Cromer, a few drinks later Dick Cole and John Quantrell met and had a talk with Wing Commander Tich Holmes, who insured the aircraft. He told us what a wonderful aircraft the Piper J3 Cub was (this was on a Saturday night) and following morning we reported this to the boys and we decided that we must buy one. We found one in a garage at Folkestone - I think John Quantrell found it - but I can't remember what the price was. Eric Jarvis and Dick Cole went round and 10 members put money up: George Jarvis, George Morrison, Tom Morrison, Dick Cole, John Freeman, R Brooks, G Urquart, Ralph Medler, Alfred Reynolds and John Quantrell.
