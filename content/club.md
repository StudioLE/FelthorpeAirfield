## The Club

In 2017, Bob Gotts took over management of the Airfield from the Felthorpe Flying Group and began construction of the new 130 mÂ² club house to complement the new hangar he built in 2011.

Felthorpe Flying Group continue to operate a de Havilland DHC1 Chipmunk and welcomes anyone interested in joining the group. Chipmunk and tailwheel conversions are available from the 2 resident FI(A) pilots.

Current residents at Felthorpe in addition to the Chipmunk are: 1940 de Havilland DH82a Tiger Moth, 1936 de Havilland DH87b Hornet Moth, Auster J1N, a Beagle A61 Terrier and a Condor; a vintage glider also lurks in the corner of the hangar. The new hangar currently houses 2 Cessna 172s, a Jabiru, a C42, an RV8, an Isaacs Fury, a Wassmer WA52 and a Chilton DW1 Monoplane, together with a Fokker DR1 Triplane under construction.
