## Procedures



Felthorpe airfield lies within the Norwich Control Zone (CTR), in Class D Airspace. The following procedures must be complied with in order to meet the requirements of the Air Navigation Order:

***** INSERT IMAGE *****


These procedures apply to all Felthorpe-based and visiting aircraft. They are straightforward but should be studied carefully before flight.

All flights planned to, from or remaining in the Felthorpe circuit must be notified and cleared with Norwich ATC by telephone before engine start (Tel: 01603 420641 or 01603 891155), and preferably after completing pre-flight checks.

#### FREQUENCIES

Norwich Tower:         124.250
Norwich Approach:    119.350
Norwich ATIS:           128.625 (Tel: 01603 420640)

####  CIRCUITS

1.Book out with Norwich ATC as above. 
2.Airfield elevation is 120ft
2.Circuit height is 500ft QFE (620ft Norwich QNH)
3.RT equipped aircraft to call Norwich Tower on 124.250 either on the ground before take-off or or asap when getting airborne 
4.Circuits should remain within 1nm of Felthorpe airfield, and remain North of the A1067 at all times.

####  AIRFIELD DEPARTURE PROCEDURES (non radio aircraft see below)

Having booked out with Norwich ATC, pilots should check in with Norwich Tower on 124.250MHz  when airborne; they will then be ‘cleared to leave the CTR via the Swannington Lane, not above 1000ft on Norwich QNH, VFR’.  Pilots should initially fly at 620ft QNH until they can be sure that there are no aircraft returning along the Swannington Lane.  On reaching Swannington the aircraft will normally be transferred to Radar on 119.350MHz.  Pilots wishing to route other than through the Swannington Lane can make the request to ATC on their initial contact with Norwich Tower.  This request may be granted but will depend on Norwich traffic.

#### ZONE ENTRY & CIRCUIT JOINING PROCEDURES (non radio aircraft see below)

Aircraft inbound to Felthorpe must not enter Norwich CTR/CTA until in receipt of a joining clearance from Radar on 119.350MHz.  They will be transferred to Tower at Swannington.  They should fly down the Swannington Lane initially at 999ft to keep clear above outbound traffic.  Once overhead Felthorpe they are in a position to see what other flying is happening on the airfield, check the wind and select the most appropriate runway, or join for the current runway in use.  Overhead the airfield they may let down to circuit height of 620ft NWI QNH; it may be necessary to complete an orbit to lose any excess height.  Clearance from other routes may be available from Norwich ATC but in all cases pilots must fly to overhead the airfield before joining the circuit.  In the event that there is no other flying at Felthorpe, or any possibility of any other flying, pilots may use their initiative when deciding how to join the airfield, but should always stick as close as possible to these published procedures.

#### VISITING AIRCRAFT

Either telephone Norwich ATC as above before departing home base and get briefed, or follow the Controlled Airspace entry procedures as above.

#### NON RADIO AIRCRAFT

Ensure that a clearance to depart or arrive has been gained before commencing flight. Note Clearances will be given with a "Time Window" (from/to) and this time limit forms part of the clearance. If you will not be able to make your arrival or departure within the time limits then you will have to land, in the case of an expired arrival slot, and contact Norwich ATC again. In the case of a departure you will have to contact Norwich ATC again for a new clearance BEFORE taking off.

#### RADIO FAILURE

In the event of RT failure, pilots may enter the Norwich CTR via the Swannington Lane, VFR, not above 1,000ft Norwich QNH but shall advise Norwich ATC by telephone after landing at Felthorpe.   

#### GENERAL

1.Where pilots request alternative routes or altitudes, Norwich Radar will issue clearances as requested to the maximum extent practicable.  
2.Pilots should be aware that flight with the Norwich CTR must be under VFR and the limits for operation for such a flight may be considered as minimum visibility of 5000m, clear of cloud. If the Norwich weather drops below these limits then entry into the zone will not be permitted. Pilots should therefore determine that the forecast for Norwich does not include any deterioration below these limits for a period of at least two hours after ETA at Felthorpe.
